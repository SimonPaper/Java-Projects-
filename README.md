# Resource-Optimization
Java implementation of some of the resource optimization algorithms I've learned at University.
So far i've written code for these purposes:
  1) read a csv file to create a matrix
  2) read a matrix to create a graph
  3) find a minimum spanning tree of a graph using Prim algorithm or Kruskal algorithm

Next steps:

- Make a UI to upload a CSV containing an adjacency matrix
- Write Dijkstra algorithm

My will is to improve the code writing of this project and to implement some more algorithms in the free time (like Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall...)
Any advice is well accepted!
