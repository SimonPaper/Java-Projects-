# Resource-Optimization
Java implementation of some of the resource optimization algorithms I've learned at University.
So far i've written code for these purposes:
  1) read a csv file to create a matrix
  2) read a matrix to create a graph, made of vertices and edges
  3) find a minimum spanning tree of a graph using Prim algorithm or Kruskal algorithm
 
My will is to improve the code writing of this project and to implement some more algorithms in the free time (like Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall...)
Any help is well accepted!
